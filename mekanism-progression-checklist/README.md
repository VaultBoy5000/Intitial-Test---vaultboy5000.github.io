# Chapter 0 - Reasoning Behind Checklist
This quick checklist is a progression guide for Mekanism. I always seem to forget the progression of Mekanism beyond 3x ore production and I hope I can clear this up for some others as well.

# Chapter 1 - Basics of Mekanism

## What is the premise of the mod?
    The premise of the mod Mekanism is to enhance the amount of yield you get out of a single ore. You can duplicate (x2 Production), triplicate (x3 Production), quadruplicate (x4 Production), and quintuplicate (x5 Production) your ores.

## What power does this mod generate?
    Mekanism generates RF (Redstone Flux) power.

## Basic Outline of Progression
    
    Abstract Generic Progress - Ingot -> Dust -> Clump -> Shard -> 

    1.) Heat Generator and Mettalurgic Infuser
        - Lava next to, or on top of Heat Generator, Heat Generator powering Mettalurgic Infuser.
        - Mettalurgic Infuser infuses ingots into Alloys, used in future advanced crafting, or Enriched Iron to Steel
    
    2.) Enrichment Chamber
        - The Enrichment Chamber can produce the following:
            Coal / Charcoal -> Compressed Carbon
            Redstone -> Compress Redstone
            Diamond -> Diamond Dust
            Refined Obsidian Dust -> Compressed Obsidian
        - Coal, Redstone, Diamond, and Refined Obsidian Dust, after you process them in the Enrichment Chamber produce more yield when used in the Mettalurgic Infuser. For example if you used a single Redstone Dust in a Metallurgic Infuser you would only get 10 mB of Redstone, while a 
    
    3. [Optional]) Energized Smelter, Precision Sawmill
        - Energized Smelter can smelt ores into Ingots or Dust into Ingots.
        - Precision Sawmill can recyle wooden items (Tools, Crafting Table, Doors, etc.) and turn it into planks as well as sawdust which you can use to create boxes.
    
    4.)  Bio-Generator, Crusher, Purification Chamber, Electrolytic Seperator
        - Bio-Generator uses Bio-Fuel to create RF. Bio-Fuel is a product of crushing Bio-Matter in a crusher (Wheat, Seeds, Saplings, etc.)
    
    5.) Osmium Compressor, Gas-Burning Generator
